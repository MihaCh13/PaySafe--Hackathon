Profile Section – Fixes Needed

Profile Photo Border

The circular border around the profile picture is way too thick.

It must be thinner, softer, and gradient-based (in a purple/phone-gradient style), matching the overall UI color scheme of the application.

Profile Photo Button

The Add Photo / Change Profile Picture button must not appear under the profile picture.

Instead, it should be placed in line with the other two buttons:

Edit Profile

Change PIN

Logo Visibility

Please increase the size of the app logo (the wallet icon) slightly so it's easier to see and more visually balanced.

✅ Transfers Section – Fixes Needed
Current Issue

In the Send Money section, the button for Bank Transfer / iBank is incorrectly implemented.

When clicked, it shows the user’s own bank details, which is wrong.

Correct Behavior

In Send Money, this button should allow the user to:

Enter someone else’s IBAN/bank details

Enter the amount

Send money to another user’s bank account

Correct Placement

The current Bank Transfer / IBAN button should be moved entirely to the Receive Money section.

✅ Receive Money Section – Fixes Needed

There is a green, dotted container showing the user's username.
The Scan QR Code button should NOT be inside that container.

Instead:

The Scan QR Code button must be placed right below the dotted container.

Below that button, there should be the Receive Money via Bank Transfer / IBAN option (with the user’s bank details).

The button for receiving money via bank transfer must show:

The user’s own bank account information, so they can give it to someone else.

👉 Summary (Short)

Make the profile picture border thin, elegant, gradient-colored.

Move the Add/Change Photo button next to Edit Profile and Change PIN.

Slightly increase the wallet logo size.

Move the current Bank Transfer/IBAN button from Send Money to Receive Money.

In Send Money, allow sending money via IBAN to someone else.

In Receive Money, place Scan QR Code below the dotted username box.

In Receive Money, show the user's bank details for incoming transfers.
