You are helping me implement and fix the "Forgot password" functionality on my Login page.

Goal:
Right now, the "Forgot password" link/form does not actually send emails. I want a complete, working password reset flow that sends real emails with a clean, modern HTML design that matches my site's color palette.

What I want you to do:

1. Implement the full "Forgot password" flow:
   - User enters their email on the "Forgot password" form.
   - If the email exists in the database, generate a secure, time-limited reset token.
   - Save the token (and expiry) in the database or appropriate store.
   - Send an email containing a link like:
     `https://<my-domain>/reset-password?token=<TOKEN>`
   - Create/ensure a "Reset Password" page that:
     - Validates the token.
     - Lets the user enter a new password and confirm password.
     - Updates the password securely and invalidates the token afterward.
   - If the email doesn’t exist, don’t reveal that in the UI (for security). Show a generic message like: “If an account with that email exists, we’ve sent a password reset link.”

2. Email sending:
   - Use a proper email-sending solution supported by Replit (e.g. SMTP with environment variables, or an email API like SendGrid/Mailgun/etc.).
   - Configure it so the credentials (API keys, SMTP username/password) are read from environment variables, not hard-coded.
   - Make sure the function actually gets called when the user submits the "Forgot password" form.

3. Email design:
   - Create a nicely formatted **HTML email** (with a plain-text fallback).
   - The email should look clean, modern, and mobile-friendly.
   - Use a simple layout: logo/title at the top, short explanatory text, a prominent “Reset Password” button, and a fallback reset link.
   - Match the colors to my site’s color palette:
     - [Describe or inspect my existing CSS and reuse primary/secondary colors, button styles, and fonts]
   - Add a small footer with a line like:
     “If you didn’t request a password reset, you can safely ignore this email.”

4. Frontend behavior:
   - On the "Forgot password" page:
     - Show success and error messages clearly.
     - After submission, show a friendly message like:
       “If an account with that email exists, you’ll receive a reset link shortly.”
   - On the "Reset password" page:
     - Validate password + confirm password (matching and basic strength).
     - Show clear error messages if the token is invalid/expired or if passwords don’t match.
     - On success, show a message and optionally redirect back to Login.

5. Code quality:
   - Don’t break existing login/signup functionality.
   - Keep the UX simple and consistent with the rest of the site.
   - Add brief comments in the key places so I understand:
     - Where the token is generated and stored
     - Where the email is sent
     - How the token is validated on the reset page

Please:
- Locate the current login/forgot password code in this Replit project.
- Implement any missing backend routes/handlers and frontend logic.
- Wire everything together so the "Forgot password" link on the login page fully works end-to-end.
