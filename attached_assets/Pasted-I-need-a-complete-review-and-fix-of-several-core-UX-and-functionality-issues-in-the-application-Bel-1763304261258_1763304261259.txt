I need a complete review and fix of several core UX and functionality issues in the application. Below is a consolidated list of problems and required improvements:

1. Notifications System – MUST Be Fully Functional

The notifications system should work consistently across the entire application.
Here are the required behaviors:

a) Notification Indicator in the Top Navbar

In the main top navigation bar (the white bar with the profile picture), there is a bell icon.

Whenever any notification exists, the bell icon must display a red indicator dot or a badge showing the number of unread notifications.

If new notifications arrive, the indicator should appear immediately.

b) Notifications for All Financial Actions

The user should receive notifications for every transaction-related event, including:

Sending money (via QR code, username, or bank account).

Receiving money (via QR code or bank details).

Any income or expense entry should generate a notification.

Loading or paying with any of the user’s Budget Cards → must trigger a notification.

Paying with the Dark Days Pocket → must trigger a notification that money was withdrawn.

c) Real-Time Pop-Up Notifications

When a notification occurs, it must appear instantly as a pop-up, similar to how mobile apps display alerts.

These pop-ups should show on top of the application view, not only in the notifications page.

2. Marketplace Layout Issues

There are major UI alignment problems in the Marketplace section:

a) “View Details” Button Should Always Be Aligned

The View Details button must appear at the same vertical position for all listings, regardless of how long the description text is.

Long text should not overlap the button.

If the text is too long, automatically truncate it with ... so layout is always clean and consistent.

3. ICIC Discounts Section Issues

In the Partner Merchants Preview:

The ICIC Discounts are missing, even though they appear in the ICIC Discounts section.

These discounts must always be visible, even if the user has not uploaded their ICIC card yet.

The discounts are part of the platform content and should always be displayed.

Overall Goal

Please fix these issues to ensure consistent UX, correct notification logic, and proper UI alignment across all components of the application.
