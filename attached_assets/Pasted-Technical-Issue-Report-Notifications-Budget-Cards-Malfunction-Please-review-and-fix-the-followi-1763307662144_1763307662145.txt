Technical Issue Report – Notifications & Budget Cards Malfunction

Please review and fix the following critical issues in the system. The notifications and transaction display logic are currently not functioning as expected.

1. Notifications Are Not Working At All

I performed two transfers of $15 each from one of my Budget Cards, and the system did not behave correctly:

No notification appeared in the Notifications section.

No real-time notification pop-up was displayed on the screen.

The bell icon in the navbar did not show any indicator or badge.

There was no “New Notification” inside the notifications page.

This means the notifications system is completely non-functional for essential actions.

2. Transactions Are Not Shown in Most Menus

Even though the transfer was successfully executed, the transaction appeared only in the Activity section.

It was not visible in:

The dashboard’s Recent Transactions section

The Recent Transfers menu

The general Transfers overview

This is a major issue because financial operations must be reflected everywhere they are expected.

3. Budget Cards – Incorrect and Incomplete Balance Display

The Budget Cards have multiple problems:

They show how much money has been spent,
but they don’t show the remaining balance on the card.

There is no clear visual indication of:

current balance

total budget

amount spent

amount left

This makes the Budget Cards unusable for actual budgeting — users need to know exactly how much money remains available.

4. Missing Real-Time Alerts for Important Events

When transferring money:

No alert appeared on the screen (like mobile apps normally do).

No push-style notification was shown.

The user receives zero feedback that a financial action has occurred.

For any financial event (payments, loading cards, transfers, incoming money), the system must immediately show:

a live pop-up alert

a notification in the Notifications section

a badge or red dot on the bell icon

None of these are happening right now.
