Please audit and fully fix all UI and functionality inconsistencies across the app, especially in the Profile and Transfer sections. Here are the required adjustments:

1. Profile Photo Behavior

The profile photo control must use a button labeled 'Add Photo' if the user has no profile picture, and 'Replace Photo' if they already have one.

If no photo is uploaded, do not display an empty white or gray circle; instead, show a circle filled with the app's signature gradient background, containing the user's initials.

Restore the gradient border around the profile photo. It should match the full UI style of the app — smooth, colorful, and consistent with the design system, not a flat or dull purple.

2. NavBar & Logo Placement

The UniPay logo + text must appear only in the always-visible top navigation bar.

The collapsible side NavBar must not show the UniPay logo or the text.

The collapsible NavBar should contain only the collapse/expand arrow, and this arrow must always be visible and functional.

3. Transfers Section (Send/Receive Money)

The 'Show QR Code' button next to the Username loads very slowly; please optimize or fix the loading behavior.

The section labels must be corrected:

'Scan QR Code' → should appear in Send Money

'Show QR Code' → should remain in its proper place (receive/request)

Restore the button that allowed sending money via bank account / IBAN, using the app’s UI color palette and proper styling.

4. Activity Sync Issues

Transactions from the backend (e.g., completed transactions dated 30.10 and others) are not being reflected in the Activity section.

Please investigate and fix the synchronization between the transaction data and the Activity feed so that all completed transfers appear correctly and immediately.

5. Missing or Lost UI Features

Several UI elements, animations, and design features that were previously implemented no longer appear.
Please restore all earlier UI/UX enhancements across all sections, including:

consistent animations when switching between pages (Dashboard, Top-Up, Transfers, Activity, Saving Goals, Budget Cards, Dark Day Pockets, IC Discounts, Marketplace, etc.)

proper color usage, spacing, and component layout as originally specified.

Please update all of these areas to match the intended UI, styling, and functional behavior of the UniPay application."
