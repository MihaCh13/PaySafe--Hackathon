Please fix the following issues in the Activity section and related components of the app:

1. Calendar in Activity – Income entries do NOT appear in green

In the Activity section, within the calendar view, income events are supposed to be visually represented in green.
Currently:

Income entries are not displayed in green at all.

Only expenses or other types of entries appear visually, while income is missing from the color-coded representation.

👉 Fix:
Ensure that all income events are properly rendered in the calendar UI, using the intended green color coding (as it worked in the previous version of the design).

2. Budget (4) and Subscriptions (1) – Cards are cut off

The buttons/cards inside these sections appear:

visually cut in half

not fitting inside their containers

misaligned or clipped

👉 Fix:
Correct layout, padding, margins, and responsive sizing so the cards render fully inside their parent containers.

3. Activity → All Transactions – Numbers do NOT match

The counters in All Transactions are inconsistent:

Income shows 7

Expenses show 14

But All shows 35 items (which is incorrect and not the sum of the two)

👉 Fix:
Verify aggregation logic across all data sources (Calendar, Budget cards, Subscriptions) and remove any duplicated or incorrectly counted entries.

4. Missing section for upcoming payments

There is currently no visualization for upcoming or scheduled payments in the Activity section or in All Transactions.

This includes:

upcoming subscription charges

scheduled budget payments

manually added future events in the calendar

👉 Fix:
Add a dedicated section: Upcoming / Expected Payments, even if the list is empty.

5. Activity → Calculator does NOT include all financial data

The calculator ignores multiple types of entries:

previous incomes

previous expenses

future subscription charges

manually scheduled items from the calendar

👉 Fix:
Ensure all past, present, and scheduled financial movements are included in the calculator logic.

6. Income is still not visualized correctly in Activity

Income entries in the Activity section:

do not appear in the list consistently

do not update the balance correctly

👉 Fix:
Render income transactions properly and ensure they contribute to the total balance.
